vipr_genotype.pl
gsun@vecna.com
Vecna Technologies, Inc


Customization:
1. Front-end of viprbrc.org, as an online tool:
1) Untar the genotype-1.3.0.tar.gz file at /opt/tools
2) Create a link at /usr/bin/vipr_genotype.pl -> /opt/tools/genotype-1.3/vipr_genotype.pl
3) Create a link at /opt/tools/genotype-1.3 -> genotype-1.3.0
These steps should make the script work.
To install to a different directory, add following to vipr_genotype.pl:
###################
use lib ("/<base_dir>/genotype-1.3.0");
###################

2. Back-end data processing:
1) The installation dir is assumed to be: /home/dbadmin/loader/ext/genotype
Thus, this also assumes the user as dbadmin. If this dir is changed, add following line to vipr_genotype.pl:
###################
use lib ("/<base_dir>/genotype-1.3.0");
###################


Requirements:
  This script requires following Perl modules:
use File::Spec::Functions;
use Bio::SeqIO;
use English;
use Carp;
use Data::Dumper;
use File::Temp;
use version; our $VERSION = qv('1.2');
use Getopt::Long;
use IO::String;
use POSIX qw(strftime ceil floor);
use Bio::TreeIO;
use Bio::AlignIO;
use Scalar::Util 'refaddr';
use Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast;

require GenotypeDraw;
use Genotype;


Version 2.0.4: Dec 08, 2017
1. Adds the position of the input sequence as an additional column in the index file

Version 2.0.2-3: Nov 29, 2017
1. Replaced built-in algorithm to parse pplacer output with cladinator from JCVI

Version 2.0.0; July 06, 2017
1. Added taxit/pplacer/guppy as alternative algorithm for HCV. This algorithm is 
a heavily modified version of Tom Smith's code for Flu H1 classfication tool.
  It requires:
1a) taxit v0.6.4. If the version is v0.3.2, change the following line in:
referenceData/hcv/HCVCladeClassn.stats from:
=====================
---  PhyML 20120412  ---
======= to: =========
  ---  PhyML v3.0  ---
=====================
1b) pplacer/guppy: pplacer-linux-v1.1.alpha19.zip
1c) Also change the directory location of pplacer to actual value in
referenceData/HCV-Advanced-IN-text-out-text.xml to:
=====================
  <Param name="pplacer" value="/opt/tools/pplacer-Linux-v1.1.alpha19"></Param>
=====================
1d) Needs MAFFT installed with:
$ sudo rpm -Uvh mafft-7.307-gcc_fc6.x86_64.rpm


Version 1.3.3
1. Added functions to clean up the refseq ids: 
Genotype_calctree::mapDefline, cleanupDefline, restoreDefline.
2. Changed profile alignment program from muscle to clustalw, in order to minimize
problem in partial query sequences.

Version 1.3.0
-Jun 13, 2014
1. Added vipr_genotype_parallel.pl script, which would take extra option
-nproc=n, and run n process in parallel. This should speed up the data
processing by a factor close to n.
  This required the Parallel::ForkManager module, which needs to be installed:
1) perl -MCPAN -e shell; 
2) force install Parallel::ForkManager
2. Added Zika virus to the list of covered species. - Feb 03, 2016


-Jun 06, 2013
1.Incorporate the Norovirus into this tool.
1a. Added capability to recognize the genotype in I.9 format.
1b. Compiled the refseqs for ORF1.
1c. Added the field region in the output file, so that more than one regions
can be handled and might give different result:
==================
JN183159       genotype        ORF2       1..2177      BI=1.000 	genotype=I.9    NoVI    20130612104825  Success
==================
1d. Added field 'region' to index file.
1e. Two graphs are produced for norovirus, one for ORF1 and one for ORF2.
1f. Found a discrepancy between same refseq in different collections used in
norotyping tool. This casts some doubt on the quality of the tool.

==============
1f. Added way to change the input taxon if the input file is in genbank
format based on genotype result. This is useful for Norovirus, as the taxon is
hard to determine based only on blast. If the input is fasta, the taxon will
be either from command line input, or blast result.
1g. Modified the way to calculate $TH_min_num_windows in sub summ_recomb,
in order to handle short input sequences.
1h. Need to add capability to determine region (ORF1 or ORF2) for norovirus,
since some short input sequences only cover one region and there is no need to
calculate both regions.
1i. Modified the code to do 2 genotype analysis for each Norovirus genome.
1j. Standard result for AB039774:
===============
#       Job_name        short_name      defline species region  status(geno)       BI(geno)        genotype        status(recomb)  BI(recomb)       recombinant     comment(geno)
1       AB039774        _seq001 AB039774        NoVI    ORF1    Success	BI=1.000        genotype=I.Pc   sub=NA          BI=     genotype=NA
2       AB039774        _seq001 AB039774        NoVI    ORF2    Success	BI=1.000        genotype=I.5    sub=NA          BI=     genotype=NA
===============



Version 1.2.2, Changes:
-Feb. 11, 2013
1. Added 'NA' to all genotype statements, so that it appears in all cases.
2. Separated the graph drawing functionality into another script, so that when
recombination analysis is not needed, the GD library doesn't need to be
installed. This is for the convenience of the backend processing.
3. Removed the -graph commandline option, as it's not useful in term of
avoiding the GenotypeDraw.pm module when no graph is needed.

Version 1.2.1, Changes:
Jan 29, 2013
##### Change #1 has been reverted in V1.2.2 #####
1. Added commandline option -graph to request a graph for the recombination
result. Without this option, a graph won't be generated.
##### #####
2. Added commandline option -debug to turn on all debug messages.
3. Added a facility script, vipr_genotype_test.pl, to search for all genomes in
test subdirectory, run the script for all, and compare the genotype
result with earlier result that is stored in test/output. A summary of all
Success/Fail is generated when the script finishes.
3. For genbank input file, if the taxon is not defined by the user, the taxon
will be obtained from the taxid within the genbank file. This is preferred
over the process built in the script.


Version 1.2, Changes:
Mar 21, 2012
1. Added capability to process multiple sequences from one fasta file. As a
result, the output files are named as <root>_seq001.*.
2. Added a index file (<root>_index.tsv) containing the job_name, sequence name, defline,
species, genotype result, and recombination result.
3. Added a file named <root>_finished.txt, which is only written right before
the script finishes. This would indicate the end of the process, and any post
processing may begin. The content of the the file simply lists how many
sequences has been process.

Jan 25, 2012
1. Added capability to process genomes in following species:
West Nile, 
Japanese encephalitis, 
St Louis encephalitis, 
Tick-borne encephalitis, 
Yellow Fever, 
Murray Valley encephalitis, and 
Bovine viral diarrhea virus.
2. Fixed several problems related to recombination analysis.

Version 1.1, Changes:
Nov 16, 2011
1. Added capability to process Dengue genomes
2. Separated the filename from the name of the sequence in a fasta file
3. Added capability to draw a bar graph, using GD library and GD::Graph Perl module
4. Output genotype result and recombination result to separate files

Version 1.0.0
1. Modeled after script from VBRC.org
2. Handles HCV genomes
3. Requires MUSCLE to align input genome with refseqs, dnadist from phylip to create distance matrix, and FastME to generate phylogeny tree
4. Converted newickBI.pl to a subroutine. Also modified the code inside for clearity and newer version of BioPerl
